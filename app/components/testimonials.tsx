I can confidently say that without her, the company would not be where it was today. \n\ Not only was she self-sufficient but she was quick to adapt to any task thrown at her, which was important as we were working in a startup environment. \n\ Putri also had initiative and drive and often made changes without me having to ask, which makes her a wonderful addition to any future team she finds herself on.",

While I handled visual asset creation, she brought them to life with her exceptional animation expertise. What stood out most was her remarkable organization skillsâ€”she meticulously managed work assets, structured folders efficiently, and maintained an impeccable layering system in Adobe After Effects. \n\ Her ability to quickly understand project briefs and seamlessly dive into work was truly impressive. She was highly cooperative, actively contributing to discussions and project goals. In summary, my collaboration with Putri was both productive and inspiring, and I highly recommend her for any animation or creative project.",
